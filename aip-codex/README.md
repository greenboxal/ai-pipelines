# aip-codex

aip-codex primary defines a Universal Abstract Syntax Tree (UAST) for representing code in arbitrary programming or natural languages.

The primary use case is to guide context retrieval in the form of a graph query.

Natural language support works primarily by following Markdown semantics, with headers, sections, and blocks forming the AST, while links, images and other elements represent references/link/edges in the graph.
